#Iris Flowers Classification Machine Learning Project
Iris Flowers

This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on classifying Iris flowers using the famous Iris dataset. The project is implemented using Jupyter Notebook and utilizes the 'iris.csv' dataset downloaded from Kaggle.

Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into their respective species based on certain features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for classification and pattern recognition tasks.

Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

notebooks/: This directory contains the Jupyter Notebook files where the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation are performed.

iris_classification.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook file containing the project code and explanations.

data/: This directory stores the dataset files.

iris.csv: The Iris dataset in CSV format, downloaded from Kaggle.

images/: This directory holds any images used in the project.

iris_types.jpg: An image of Iris flowers used for illustration purposes.

README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project, its structure, and usage instructions.

Getting Started
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/sherinjim/iris-flowers-classification-ML-repo.git

2.Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook notebooks/iris flowers classification.ipynb

3.Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.
